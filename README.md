# Welcome to Project AirSim

Project AirSim is a simulation platform for drones, robots, and other autonomous systems.

Building on the previous work of **[AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim)**, it leverages **[Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/)** to provide photo-realistic visuals, while providing the simulation framework needed to integrate custom physics, controllers, actuators, and sensors to develop an autonomous system.

**IAMAI Simulations** is composed of former engineers from the original AirSim project at Microsoft, who have decided to continue its development after Microsoft discontinued the project. With their expertise, the team is committed to advancing the platform and fostering innovation in autonomous systems.

Project AirSim consists of three main layers:

1. **Project AirSim Sim Libs** - Base infrastructure for defining a generic robot structure and simulation scene tick loop

2. **Project AirSim Plugin** - Host package (currently an Unreal Plugin) that builds on the sim libs to connect external components (controller, physics, rendering) at runtime that are specific to each configured robot-type scenario (ex. quadrotor drones)

3. **Project AirSim Client Library** - End-user library to enable API calls to interact with the robot and simulation over a network connection

For more details on the architecture, see **[Project AirSim Architecture Overview](docs/development/use_source.md#airsim-v-next-architecture-overview)**.

Project AirSim currently supports Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22. For more info about hardware specs for working with Project AirSim, see **[System Specifications](docs/system_specs.md)**.

## Open Source Commitment

We believe that open-source is the best way to foster innovation and collaboration in robotics simulation. Project AirSim can only thrive if it's built together — not by a single corporation, but by all of us.

We invite you to become part of this journey: contribute code, share feedback, report issues, and help shape the future of the platform.

## Enterprise Support

IAMAI Simulations offers professional **Enterprise Support** for teams and organizations building on Project AirSim.

Whether you're working on large-scale simulations, custom features, or integration into your existing stack, we can help you move faster and with confidence.

We invite you to participate and help shape the future of Project AirSim.

## Getting Started

See **[Installing system prerequisites](docs/system_specs.md#installing-system-prerequisites)** for information about Windows/Linux system setup needed before running Project AirSim.

### 1. Pre-built environment binaries

> I just want to download and run a Project AirSim environment and drive it with some Python code.

*Note:* You can either build Project AirSim from source or download pre-built binaries to use with the Python client.

#### **[Use pre-built binary environments](docs/development/use_prebuilt.md)**

### 2. Develop with Project AirSim source

> I'm going to build the sim libs, Plugin, Blocks, and my own UE project environment from the ground up so I can customize it to my application.

#### **[Build from source as a developer](docs/development/use_source.md)**

## Quick Start: Run from Source

Follow these steps to set up and run Project AirSim from source:

### 1. Install Unreal Engine 5.2
- Download and install **[Unreal Engine 5.2](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)**.
- Set the `UE_ROOT` environment variable to the Unreal Engine installation path:
  ```bash
  export UE_ROOT=/path/to/UnrealEngine
  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies (Linux Only)
- Run the setup script to install required development tools:
  ```bash
  ./setup_linux_dev_tools.sh
  ```

### 3. Build Simulation Libraries
- Build the simulation libraries in debug mode:
  - **Linux/macOS**:
    ```bash
    ./build.sh simlibs_debug
    ```
  - **Windows** (use "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022"):
    ```cmd
    build.cmd simlibs_debug
    ```

### 4. Generate Project Files
- Generate Visual Studio Code project files:
  - **Linux/macOS**:
    ```bash
    ./blocks_genprojfiles_vscode.sh
    ```
  - **Windows**:
    ```cmd
    blocks_genprojfiles_vscode.bat
    ```

### 5. Open and Run the Editor
- Open the generated workspace in Visual Studio Code.
- Launch the Unreal Engine editor in DebugGame mode.

Once the editor is running, you can explore and interact with the simulation environment.

## Running Headless (Docker)

If you need to run a Project AirSim simulation on a headless system, such as in a Docker container, you can enable off-screen rendering by adding the `-RenderOffScreen` argument when launching the Unreal environment executable:

```
Blocks{.exe/.sh} -RenderOffScreen
```

If you are running without GPU access and want to run without any image rendering, you can disable rendering completely by adding the `-nullrhi` argument:

```
Blocks{.exe/.sh} -nullrhi
```

These arguments can also be used while debugging in VS Code by modifying the `launch.json` file, or in Visual Studio 2022 by modifying the project's `Configuration Properties`. See **[Running Headless (Docker, Azure Cloud)](docs/development/headless_cloud.md)** for more details.
